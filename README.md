Instances where I've encountered an interesting coding problem, set out to solve it and learned things in the process. To read about 
the lessons I've learned from these exercises, follow my blog (to be updated).

# zero2inf_and_back.R
My answer to the Amazon interview question: 

“You have two operations: add by one and multiply by 2. Find the minimum number of operations to get from 0 to any particular integer.”

This file contains R code for the function zero_2_inf, which answers this question. I then get creative with inf_2_zero, which is the same 
function worked backwards using the operations 'subtract by one' and 'divide by two'. I also graph the solutions these functions generate for integer values of up to 10,000 to working backwards from the final integer provides more accurate results than starting from 0.

# patient_doc_scheduler.py
An early foray into coding in Python. I chose this exercise as my final capstone project for the udemy course 'Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3'. The spec is as follows:

"Create a patient class and a doctor class. Have a doctor that can handle multiple patients and setup a scheduling program where a doctor can only handle 16 patients during an 8 hr work day."

The code took me 3-4 days to write. The solution is my own, with minimal help from others, and so may have a slightly different implementation compared to others who have also done this exercise.
